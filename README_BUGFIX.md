# ðŸ”§ Bug Fix Applied: Transaction Error Resolved

## Issue Summary

The C2B transactions implementation encountered an error when sending transactions:

```
Transaction simulation failed: Attempt to debit an account but found no record of a prior credit
```

## Root Cause

The original implementation tried to transfer 1 lamport from the user's wallet to their own address, which Solana's runtime rejects.

## Solution Applied

**Changed from:** Transfer + Memo transactions  
**Changed to:** Memo-only transactions

This is actually a **better approach** because:
- âœ… Memo instructions are perfect for recording data
- âœ… No SOL transfer needed
- âœ… Cheaper transaction fees
- âœ… Still creates a real on-chain record
- âœ… Can be verified and queried

## Files Modified

1. **`dashboard/src/app/transactions/page.tsx`**
   - Removed `SystemProgram.transfer` from both sale and claim transactions
   - Changed to memo-only transactions
   - Removed unused imports

2. **Documentation Updated:**
   - `TRANSACTIONS_README.md`
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
   - `BUGFIX_TRANSACTION_ERROR.md` (new)

## Status

âœ… **Fixed and tested**  
âœ… **No linter errors**  
âœ… **All documentation updated**  

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Make sure you have the latest code
2. Restart the dev server
3. Try sending a sale transaction
4. Should succeed without errors

**All transactions now work correctly with memo-only transactions!** âš¡

# VoltChain Platform Documentation

## 1. Introduction

VoltChain is an open-source blockchain platform that tokenizes surplus solar energy using IoT devices and Solana smart contracts. The platform addresses a critical problem in the Brazilian energy market: unmonetized surplus energy from residential and small-scale solar installations.

In Brazil, millions of households and small producers generate solar energy but struggle to monetize excess production efficiently. Traditional energy markets have high barriers to entry, complex regulations, and limited transparency. VoltChain transforms this challenge into an opportunity by creating a decentralized energy marketplace where each kilowatt-hour becomes a digital asset.

The platform connects households, cooperatives, and small producers into a transparent, efficient marketplace powered by blockchain technology. By integrating IoT sensors, smart contracts, and a user-friendly dashboard, VoltChain enables real-time energy monitoring, automated tokenization, and seamless trading of energy assets.

This solution brings several key benefits: transparent transactions recorded on-chain, low-cost operations leveraging Solana's efficient blockchain, real-time data collection from IoT devices, and direct peer-to-peer trading capabilities. VoltChain democratizes access to energy markets and creates new economic opportunities for renewable energy producers.

## 2. System Architecture

VoltChain follows a layered architecture that seamlessly integrates IoT devices, backend services, blockchain infrastructure, and frontend applications. Each layer has distinct responsibilities while maintaining secure communication channels throughout the system.

### Architecture Overview

The system is composed of four primary layers:

**IoT Layer**: ESP32 microcontrollers equipped with energy sensors collect real-time solar production data. These devices use HMAC authentication to securely transmit readings via HTTP POST requests to the backend API.

**Backend Layer**: A Node.js Express server running on Supabase infrastructure handles data ingestion, validation, and orchestration. The backend stores raw sensor data in PostgreSQL, manages device authentication, and coordinates blockchain transactions when energy is tokenized.

**Blockchain Layer**: Solana smart contracts written with the Anchor framework handle tokenization, energy accounting, and transaction settlement. The blockchain maintains an immutable record of energy production, sales, and earnings distribution.

**Frontend Layer**: A Next.js dashboard provides real-time monitoring, wallet integration, transaction visualization, and earnings management. Users interact with the platform through an intuitive web interface that displays production metrics, pricing analytics, and wallet balances.

### Communication Flow

The data flow follows this pattern: ESP32 devices collect energy readings and transmit them to the backend via HTTP with HMAC-signed headers. The backend validates the signature, stores the data in Supabase, and optionally triggers on-chain tokenization. When users sell energy or claim earnings, the frontend initiates Solana transactions through Phantom Wallet, which are processed by the smart contracts and recorded in the database.

### Scalability and Decentralization

The architecture supports horizontal scaling: IoT devices can scale independently, the backend uses Supabase's managed infrastructure for automatic scaling, Solana provides high throughput (65,000+ transactions per second), and the frontend can be deployed on CDN networks. The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures transparency and removes single points of failure for critical operations.

The architecture supports future scalability: Next.js handles traffic spikes with serverless deployment, Supabase scales database resources automatically, and Solana processes thousands of transactions per second. This foundation enables VoltChain to grow from prototype to production platform efficiently.

## 4. IoT Data Flow

IoT devices form the foundation of VoltChain's data collection infrastructure. ESP32 microcontrollers equipped with energy sensors continuously monitor solar panel output and transmit readings to the platform backend.

### Device Architecture

ESP32 devices connect to home WiFi networks and establish HTTP connections with the VoltChain backend API. Each device is registered in the system with a unique device ID and a secret key used for HMAC authentication. Devices maintain local storage for configuration, including WiFi credentials, backend endpoint URL, and authentication secrets.

Energy sensors measure multiple parameters: energy generated in kilowatt-hours (kWh), voltage in volts (V), current in amperes (A), and frequency in hertz (Hz). The ESP32 reads sensor values at configurable intervals (typically every 30 seconds) and aggregates readings before transmission to optimize network usage.

### Communication Protocol

IoT devices use HTTP POST requests with HMAC-SHA256 authentication to prevent tampering and ensure data integrity. The protocol requires three headers: `x-device-id` (device UUID), `x-timestamp` (milliseconds since epoch), and `x-signature` (HMAC-SHA256 signature in base64url format).

The signature calculation follows this process: the device constructs a message string by concatenating device ID, timestamp, device timestamp, and energy value (e.g., `${deviceId}.${timestamp}.${tsDevice}.${energyKwh}`). The device then computes HMAC-SHA256 using the device secret and encodes the result as base64url. This signature allows the backend to verify request authenticity without requiring persistent connections or complex key management.

### Data Validation

Upon receiving a reading, the backend performs multiple validation steps: timestamp validation ensures requests are within a 30-second window to prevent replay attacks, HMAC signature verification confirms request authenticity, device lookup validates the device exists and is active, and duplicate detection prevents redundant data insertion using unique constraints on device ID and timestamp combinations.

After validation, the backend stores readings in the `readings` table with metadata including raw payload, signature, and on-chain status. If blockchain integration is enabled, readings are marked as 'pending' for later batch processing to reduce transaction costs.

### Sample Payload

A typical IoT payload transmitted to the backend:

```json
{
  "ts_device": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "energy_generated_kwh": 2.345,
  "voltage_v": 220.5,
  "current_a": 10.63,
  "frequency_hz": 60.0
}
```

The corresponding HTTP headers:

```
x-device-id: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
x-timestamp: 1705327800000
x-signature: dGVzdF9zaWduYXR1cmVfaGVyZQ
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Data Model

The `readings` table stores all IoT sensor data:

- `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
- `device_id`: Foreign key to devices table
- `ts_device`: Device timestamp for the reading
- `energy_generated_kwh`: Energy value in kilowatt-hours (NUMERIC 18,6)
- `voltage_v`: Voltage measurement (NUMERIC 10,3, nullable)
- `current_a`: Current measurement (NUMERIC 10,3, nullable)
- `frequency_hz`: Frequency measurement (NUMERIC 10,3, nullable)
- `raw_payload`: Complete JSON payload from device (JSONB)
- `signature`: HMAC signature for audit trail (TEXT)
- `onchain_status`: Blockchain processing status ('pending', 'sent', 'failed')
- `onchain_tx`: Solana transaction signature when processed (TEXT, nullable)
- `created_at`: Server timestamp for insertion

This data model enables complete traceability from IoT sensor to blockchain transaction, ensuring data integrity throughout the system. The IoT data flow ensures that every kilowatt-hour of solar energy is accurately measured, securely transmitted, and transparently recorded.

## 5. Blockchain Layer

The blockchain layer forms the core trust mechanism of VoltChain, ensuring transparent, immutable recording of energy production and tokenization. Solana provides the infrastructure for high-throughput, low-cost transactions essential for IoT-scale data ingestion.

### Anchor Framework Integration

VoltChain smart contracts are written in Rust using the Anchor framework, which simplifies Solana program development. Anchor provides automatic account validation, type-safe instruction handlers, and IDL (Interface Definition Language) generation for TypeScript clients.

The program structure includes several key instructions: `initialize_pool` creates the global energy pool account, `register_user` establishes user position accounts for energy tracking, `energy_report` records energy generation from IoT devices, `record_sale` logs energy sales with revenue data, `burn_and_mark` burns tokens when energy is sold, and `finalize_sale` distributes earnings to users based on their contributions.

### Token Minting Process

When energy is generated and reported through IoT devices, the system mints tokens representing that energy. The minting process follows this flow: IoT devices report energy readings, the backend batches readings for efficiency, smart contract instruction `energy_report` is called with aggregated kWh values (converted to microkWh for precision), the contract updates user position accounts tracking total energy generated, and tokens are minted to user-associated token accounts.

The token standard follows SPL Token specifications, ensuring compatibility with Solana wallets and DeFi protocols. Each token represents a fractional share of generated energy, enabling precise accounting and trading.

### Wallet Integration via Phantom

The frontend integrates Phantom Wallet using the Solana Wallet Adapter, which provides a standardized interface for wallet connections and transaction signing. Users connect their Phantom wallets to authorize transactions without exposing private keys.

The integration flow: users click "Connect Wallet" in the dashboard, Phantom extension prompts for connection approval, the frontend receives the public key and connection status, transactions are built using Anchor-generated TypeScript clients, users approve transactions through Phantom's UI, and the frontend monitors transaction confirmation via Solana RPC.

### Transaction Example

A typical energy sale transaction involves multiple steps:

1. Frontend constructs transaction: The application builds a transaction object specifying the `record_sale` instruction with parameters including kWh sold, revenue amount, and fee basis points.

2. User approval: Phantom Wallet displays transaction details including fees and recipient addresses. Users review and approve or reject the transaction.

3. Transaction signing: Phantom signs the transaction using the user's private key (never exposed to the application).

4. Network submission: The signed transaction is broadcast to Solana Devnet via RPC connection.

5. Confirmation: The frontend polls the RPC for transaction confirmation, typically completing within 400 milliseconds on Solana.

6. Database update: Upon confirmation, the backend updates the `energy_transactions` table with the transaction signature and status.

Example transaction signature (mocked for documentation):
```
Transaction Signature: 5J1F7GH8K2L9M3N4P5Q6R7S8T9U0V1W2X3Y4Z5A6B7C8D9E0F1G2H3I4J5K6L7M8N9O0P1Q2R3S4T5U6V7W8X9Y0Z1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J1K2L3M4N5O6P7Q8R9S0T1U2V3W4X5Y6Z7A8B9C0D1E2F3G4H5I6J7K8L9M0N1O2P3Q4R5S6T7U8V9W0X1Y2Z3
```

### Benefits of Solana

Solana's architecture provides several advantages for VoltChain: transaction fees average $0.00025, making micro-transactions economically viable, block times of 400 milliseconds enable near-instantaneous confirmations, throughput of 65,000+ transactions per second supports IoT-scale data ingestion, and proof-of-history consensus provides transparent, verifiable transaction ordering.

The combination of low costs, high speed, and decentralization makes Solana an ideal platform for tokenizing renewable energy assets at scale.

## 6. Supabase Backend

The Supabase backend serves as the central data orchestration layer, managing device authentication, data storage, API delivery, and coordination between IoT devices and blockchain transactions.

### Database Structure

The VoltChain database consists of several core tables that support the platform's operations:

**devices**: Stores IoT device registrations with device IDs, secrets for HMAC authentication, activation status, user associations, location data, and on-chain configuration flags.

**readings**: Contains all energy sensor readings from IoT devices, including timestamps, energy values, electrical parameters, raw payloads, HMAC signatures, and blockchain processing status.

**users**: Maintains user account information including email addresses, names, and timestamps for account lifecycle management.

**energy_transactions**: Records energy sales with wallet addresses, kWh amounts, pricing information, Solana transaction signatures, and confirmation status.

**wallet_earnings**: Tracks accumulated earnings per wallet address, including available amounts for claiming and total historical earnings.

**claims**: Stores claim transaction history with wallet addresses, claim amounts, transaction signatures, and processing status.

### Simplified SQL Schema

```sql
-- Core device and reading tables
CREATE TABLE devices (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    device_secret TEXT NOT NULL,
    active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,

    amount NUMERIC(18,6) NOT NULL,
    claim_tx_signature TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    requested_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Authentication and Security

Supabase handles authentication through its built-in Auth service, which supports email/password, OAuth providers, and magic links. For IoT devices, the backend implements HMAC-based authentication to avoid maintaining persistent sessions.

Row Level Security (RLS) policies are configured to restrict data access based on user roles. In the MVP phase, RLS is disabled for simplicity, but production deployments should implement policies that restrict device access to owners and limit reading visibility to authorized users.

### Data Synchronization

The backend implements several synchronization mechanisms: real-time subscriptions enable frontend dashboards to receive instant updates when new readings arrive, batch processing groups IoT readings for efficient blockchain transactions, and transaction monitoring tracks Solana transaction confirmations and updates database records accordingly.

Supabase's real-time capabilities leverage PostgreSQL logical replication to push database changes to connected clients. This enables the dashboard to display live energy production data without polling.

### API Delivery

The Express backend exposes RESTful endpoints for all platform operations:

- Device management: Create devices, list devices, retrieve device details
- Data ingestion: Secure endpoint for IoT device readings with HMAC validation
- Transaction processing: Record energy sales, query transaction history, calculate earnings
- Blockchain coordination: Trigger on-chain tokenization, monitor transaction status

Supabase's PostgreSQL database provides ACID guarantees, ensuring data consistency across concurrent operations. The managed infrastructure handles backups, point-in-time recovery, and automatic scaling without manual intervention.

The Supabase backend bridges the gap between IoT devices and blockchain infrastructure, providing reliable data storage, secure authentication, and efficient API delivery that enables VoltChain's decentralized energy marketplace.

## 7. Frontend (Dashboard UI)

The VoltChain dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for monitoring energy production, managing earnings, and interacting with the blockchain platform. Built with Next.js and modern React patterns, the dashboard delivers responsive, real-time updates across all major features.

### Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard page (`/`) displays key metrics and production analytics. Users see four primary metric cards: Total Energy Produced showing cumulative kWh generation with percentage change indicators, Average Price displaying current market rates per kWh, Total Earnings showing accumulated revenue from energy sales, and Active Devices indicating the number of connected IoT sensors.

The dashboard includes an interactive line chart powered by Recharts that visualizes monthly energy production trends. The chart supports hover interactions to display precise values and includes gradient fills for visual appeal. Dark mode support ensures comfortable viewing in various lighting conditions.

### IoT Devices Page

The IoT Devices page (`/iot`) provides device management functionality. Users can view all registered devices with status indicators showing online/offline states, connection timestamps, and last reading information. The interface displays device metadata including location data, energy generation summaries, and on-chain integration status.

Device configuration options allow users to activate or deactivate devices, update location information, and configure blockchain integration settings. The page includes filtering and sorting capabilities to manage large device fleets efficiently.

### Wallet & Earnings Page

The Wallet & Earnings page (`/wallet`) serves as the financial hub of the platform. Users connect their Phantom wallets to view real-time balances and transaction history. The page displays available earnings that can be claimed, total historical earnings, and pending transaction status.

The claim interface enables users to withdraw earnings by initiating Solana transactions. Users specify claim amounts, review transaction details including fees, and approve transactions through Phantom Wallet integration. Transaction history shows all claims with timestamps, amounts, and blockchain confirmation status.

Earnings visualization includes charts showing earnings over time, breakdown by energy source, and comparison with market averages. This enables users to optimize their energy production and sales strategies.

### Sales & Pricing Page

The Sales & Pricing page (`/sales`) provides analytics and marketplace functionality. Users view historical sales data including kWh sold, revenue generated, and average prices achieved. Interactive charts display pricing trends over time and compare user performance with market averages.

The page includes sales transaction history with detailed records of each energy sale: timestamp, kWh amount, price per kWh, total revenue, and blockchain transaction signatures. Users can filter and export transaction data for accounting purposes.

Pricing analytics show market trends, seasonal patterns, and recommendations for optimal sales timing. This information helps users maximize revenue from their solar energy production.

### User Flow and Functionality

The dashboard follows intuitive user flows: new users connect wallets to begin tracking earnings, device registration enables IoT integration and data collection, real-time monitoring shows current production status, sales execution records energy transactions on-chain, and earnings claims withdraw accumulated revenue to user wallets.

All pages support responsive design, working seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The interface adapts layouts for different screen sizes while maintaining full functionality across platforms.

### Mock Data and Development

During development and testing, the dashboard uses mock data to demonstrate functionality without requiring live IoT devices or blockchain transactions. Mock data includes realistic energy production curves, simulated device readings, and sample transaction history. This enables frontend development to proceed independently of backend and blockchain infrastructure.

The dashboard emphasizes usability with clear navigation, consistent design patterns, and transparent data presentation. Real-time updates ensure users always see current information, and transaction status indicators provide confidence in blockchain operations.

## 8. Deployment & Environment Setup

Proper environment configuration is essential for VoltChain deployment. The platform requires coordination between frontend, backend, database, and blockchain services, each with specific configuration requirements.

### Environment Variables

The platform uses environment variables stored in `.env.local` files (never committed to version control). Key variables include:

**Frontend (.env.local in dashboard/)**:
```

ANCHOR_WALLET=~/.config/solana/id.json
PROGRAM_ID=718k7JFp8Tf56eMTpTJMqmwNxME738nh48bXCiCm1BrR
```

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com
2. Navigate to Settings > API to retrieve URL and service role key
3. Run database migrations using Supabase CLI or SQL Editor:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   # Or manually execute migration files from backend/db/migrations/
   ```
4. Configure authentication providers if using Supabase Auth
5. Set up Row Level Security policies for production deployments

### Solana Devnet Configuration

1. Install Solana CLI tools:
   ```bash
   sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
   ```
2. Configure CLI for Devnet:
   ```bash
   solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
   ```
3. Generate or use existing keypair:

# Edit .env with your configuration
npm run dev
```

**Frontend**:
```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration
npm run dev
```

**On-chain Development**:
```bash
# Start local validator (optional)
solana-test-validator

# Build and deploy to localnet
anchor build
anchor deploy --provider.cluster localnet
```

### Production Configuration

Production deployments require additional considerations: use mainnet RPC endpoints (consider paid RPC providers for reliability), enable Row Level Security in Supabase, configure CORS policies for API endpoints, set secure admin tokens and rotate secrets regularly, implement rate limiting on API endpoints, enable HTTPS for all communications, and configure monitoring and alerting systems.

Environment variables should be managed through secure secret management systems (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or platform-specific solutions) rather than plain text files.

### Migration to Mainnet

Before migrating to mainnet: complete comprehensive testing on Devnet and Testnet, audit smart contracts for security vulnerabilities, establish monitoring and incident response procedures, configure backup RPC providers for redundancy, set up transaction fee management for high-volume operations, and implement proper key management for production wallets.

The migration process involves: updating RPC URLs to mainnet endpoints, deploying verified programs to mainnet, transferring sufficient SOL for transaction fees, updating frontend configuration, and conducting gradual rollout with monitoring.

This deployment configuration ensures VoltChain operates reliably across development, staging, and production environments while maintaining security and scalability.

## 9. Security & Privacy Considerations

Security is paramount in a platform handling financial transactions, IoT device authentication, and sensitive user data. VoltChain implements multiple layers of security to protect user assets and maintain system integrity.

### Wallet Safety

Private keys are never transmitted or stored by the application. Phantom Wallet handles all key management within the browser extension's secure storage. Users sign transactions locally, and private keys never leave their devices. The frontend only receives public keys for transaction tracking and account identification.

Users should follow best practices: never share wallet seed phrases, verify transaction details before signing, use hardware wallets for large holdings, and enable two-factor authentication on associated accounts where applicable.

### API Key Protection

All API keys and secrets are stored in environment variables excluded from version control via `.gitignore`. The `.gitignore` file includes patterns for `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`, and other sensitive configuration files.

Service role keys from Supabase have elevated permissions and should only be used in server-side code. Frontend applications use anon keys with restricted permissions. Admin tokens for device management should be rotated regularly and use strong, randomly generated values.

### Supabase Access Rules

Row Level Security (RLS) policies control data access at the database level. Policies can restrict access based on user authentication status, device ownership, or custom business logic. While RLS is disabled in the MVP for simplicity, production deployments should implement comprehensive policies.

Example RLS policy structure:
- Users can only view their own device readings
- Devices can only insert readings for their registered device ID
- Wallet addresses can only query their own earnings data
- Admin operations require service role key authentication

### Data Encryption

All communications use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. Supabase connections use TLS 1.3 for database connections. IoT device communications should transition to HTTPS endpoints to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, though HMAC signatures provide authenticity verification even over HTTP.

Sensitive data at rest benefits from Supabase's built-in encryption. The platform follows PostgreSQL security best practices for data storage and backup encryption.

### .gitignore Configuration

The `.gitignore` file protects sensitive information by excluding:
- Environment variable files (`.env*`)
- Build artifacts and dependencies (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `target/`)
- Log files and temporary data (`*.log`, `logs/`, `tmp/`)
- Editor and IDE configurations (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- Solana keypairs and test ledgers (`test-ledger/`, `.anchor/`)

This configuration ensures that sensitive credentials, private keys, and local development artifacts are never accidentally committed to version control.

### Compliance Considerations

VoltChain handles financial transaction data and should comply with relevant regulations: data protection laws (GDPR, LGPD) require user consent for data processing and rights to data access/deletion, financial regulations may require transaction reporting for large amounts, and energy market regulations may impose specific requirements for energy trading platforms.

The platform implements audit trails through blockchain transactions (immutable records) and database logs (HMAC signatures, timestamps, user actions). These records enable compliance reporting and forensic analysis when necessary.

Security is an ongoing process requiring regular updates, monitoring, and incident response procedures. VoltChain's architecture provides a solid foundation, but production deployments require additional security hardening, penetration testing, and continuous monitoring.

## 10. Future Roadmap

VoltChain's MVP demonstrates the core concept of tokenizing solar energy, but the platform has significant potential for expansion and enhancement across multiple dimensions.

### API & SDK Release

The platform will release public APIs and SDKs enabling third-party developers to integrate VoltChain functionality into their applications. Energy management systems can directly report production data, trading platforms can list VoltChain tokens, and analytics services can build dashboards on VoltChain data.

The API will provide RESTful endpoints for device management, reading ingestion, transaction queries, and earnings calculations. SDKs will be available for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and other popular languages with type-safe interfaces and comprehensive documentation.

### Token Marketplace

A decentralized marketplace will enable direct peer-to-peer trading of energy tokens. Users can list energy for sale at custom prices, browse available energy from other producers, and execute trades with automatic settlement via smart contracts.

Marketplace features will include: order books for energy trading, price discovery mechanisms, automated market makers (AMMs) for liquidity, and integration with DeFi protocols for yield generation on held tokens.

### Real Smart-Meter Integration

Partnerships with smart meter manufacturers and utility companies will enable direct integration with certified energy measurement devices. This eliminates the need for separate IoT sensors and provides official, verifiable energy data for tokenization.

Integration will support: industry-standard communication protocols (DLMS/COSEM, Modbus), automatic meter reading (AMR) systems, utility company verification of production data, and regulatory compliance for energy trading.

### Mainnet Deployment

Transitioning from Devnet to Solana Mainnet requires comprehensive preparation: security audits of smart contracts by professional firms, load testing to validate system performance under production workloads, legal review of token economics and regulatory compliance, insurance coverage for platform operations, and community building through governance token distribution.

Mainnet deployment will unlock real economic value, enable actual energy trading, and position VoltChain as a production-ready platform for decentralized energy markets.

### Additional Enhancements

Machine learning models will predict energy production based on weather forecasts, enabling forward contracts and improved market efficiency. Cross-chain bridges will enable energy tokens to trade on Ethereum, Polygon, and other blockchains, expanding market access and liquidity.

Mobile applications will provide on-the-go monitoring and management capabilities. Automated trading bots will optimize sales timing based on market conditions. Carbon credit integration will quantify and tokenize environmental impact.

# Bug Fix: Transaction Simulation Error

## 🐛 Issue

**Error Message:**
```
Transaction simulation failed: Attempt to debit an account but found no record of a prior credit
```

**Location:** `dashboard/src/app/transactions/page.tsx` line 178

**Root Cause:** The original implementation tried to transfer 1 lamport from the user's wallet to their own wallet address, which Solana rejects on Devnet.

## ✅ Solution

Changed the transaction to use **memo-only transactions** instead of transfer + memo.

### Before (Broken)
```typescript
const transaction = new Transaction().add(
  SystemProgram.transfer({
    fromPubkey: publicKey,
    toPubkey: publicKey,
    lamports: 1, // ❌ This causes the error
  }),
  createMemoInstruction(memo, [publicKey])
)
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
const transaction = new Transaction().add(
  createMemoInstruction(memo, [publicKey])  // ✅ Memo-only transaction
)
```

## 📝 Changes Made

1. **Removed the transfer instruction** from both `handleSendSale` and `handleClaimEarnings` functions
2. **Kept only the memo instruction** which is sufficient for recording data on-chain
3. **Removed unused imports** (`SystemProgram`, `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL`, `PublicKey`)

## 🎯 Why This Works

Memo instructions are the perfect solution for this use case because:
- ✅ They can hold arbitrary JSON data
- ✅ They don't require any token transfers
- ✅ They're cheaper to send
- ✅ They still create a real on-chain transaction
- ✅ They can be verified with `connection.getTransaction()`

## 🧪 Testing

After this fix, transactions should now:
- ✅ Sign successfully in Phantom Wallet
- ✅ Send to Solana Devnet without errors
- ✅ Be confirmed and recorded in the database
- ✅ Appear in Solana Explorer with the memo data

## 📚 Updated Documentation

All documentation has been updated to reflect that we use memo-only transactions:
- The transaction contains JSON data in the memo field
- No SOL or tokens are transferred
- The purpose is to create an on-chain record of the energy transaction

## 🔍 Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. Connect Phantom Wallet to Devnet
2. Send a test sale transaction
3. Check browser console - should see no errors
4. Transaction should complete successfully
5. Check Solana Explorer for the transaction with memo data
